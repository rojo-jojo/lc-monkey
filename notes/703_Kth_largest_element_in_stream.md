# 703. Kth largest element in a stream

## Notes
- This is a minheap question
- hint: Any number which is smaller than the kth largest element now will always be smaller than the kth largest even after we add more numbers to the heap

## Code

```python
class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.minHeap = nums
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]
```
